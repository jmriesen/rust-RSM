//! This crate provides mumps language support for the [tree-sitter][] parsing library.
//!
//! Typically, you will use the [language][language func] function to add this language to a
//! tree-sitter [Parser][], and then use the parser to parse some code:
//!
//! ```
//! let code = "";
//! let mut parser = tree_sitter::Parser::new();
//! parser.set_language(tree_sitter_mumps::language()).expect("Error loading mumps grammar");
//! let tree = parser.parse(code, None).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! [Language]: https://docs.rs/tree-sitter/*/tree_sitter/struct.Language.html
//! [language func]: fn.language.html
//! [Parser]: https://docs.rs/tree-sitter/*/tree_sitter/struct.Parser.html
//! [tree-sitter]: https://tree-sitter.github.io/
